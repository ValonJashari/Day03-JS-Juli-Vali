    <!-- # Basic Exercise 1 | Temperature v1.0

    Create a program that according to the temperature will provide you with the information, whether the weather is cold or moderate. This program should generate a different random number every time, which should be between -5c and 25c. If the temperature is between -5c and 10c print "The weather is cold" otherwise print "The weather is moderate". 

    Hint: Math.random() will give you a random number between 0 and 1, but it will not reach number 0 or 1, so any value between these two numbers (for example 0,315 , 0,91239 0,1) so if you try to multiply it with 10, you can have a random number between 0 and 10 :) . -->


    <script>

        function weatherWarning() {
            var min = -5;
            var max = 25;
            var temp = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1 - min)) + min; 
            // or easy version: * (max + (positive)min)) - (positive)min)

            document.write(temp + " degrees <br>");

            if (temp <= 10) {
                document.write("The weather is cold");
            } else {
                document.write("The weather is moderate")
            }

        }

        weatherWarning();
